### [Building Intelligent Search Systems with LLM-Gym Architecture](../llm-gym-architecture.md)
*November 2024 • 6 min read*

Modern knowledge management requires more than traditional search - it needs intelligent systems that can understand context, semantics, and user intent. This article explores the architecture of LLM-Gym, demonstrating how to build sophisticated search and chat systems over curated content.

The system implements a three-layer orchestration pattern combining hybrid search strategies, multi-database architecture, and intelligent context management. Key innovations include specialized database usage and reciprocal rank fusion for optimal search results.

### [Scaling Transaction Tagging: From Rules to ML at 10M+ Transactions](../transaction-tagging-ml.md)
*December 2024 • 10 min read*

Building intelligent financial systems requires solving complex data challenges at scale. This article explores the architecture and implementation of an automated transaction tagging system that processes over 10 million transactions, transitioning from rule-based approaches to sophisticated ML pipelines.

The enterprise-scale system demonstrates how to handle unstructured financial data, implement learning algorithms that adapt to user behavior, and deploy ML models capable of processing millions of transactions daily while maintaining high accuracy and sub-100ms response times.
